## EduRain Front-End

This is the repo for all of the code related to the front-end of our webapp.  
For simplicitie's sake, we are just using different folders in place of different branches.  
The "edurain-ui" folder is getting renamed to "edurain-vue-webapp", and contains are Vue webapp.  
The "dashboard-ui-vanilla" folder is to share and review the design of the project, which will eventually be converted into Vue components.  

## Objectives:  

Build a webapp that shows the user our scholarhsips, their matched scholarships, templates for writing scholarships, and their profile information.  
We will also be including views and routing for sign in, sign up, and the profile survey.  

These requirements are subject to change, but hopefully we'll have something more concrete soon!
